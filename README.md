# Chatbots Streamlit!

This project is a independent branch of the first project, just related to chatbots.
These apps are getting more popular, so I'm here doing my part!

My ideias are simple. Just two chats related to Nutrition with physical exercises, and a Data scientist Expert. Each one will be in each folder.

And an update, from now on, I will be using poetry has my package manager, is it just easier.

For my API key, I'll use the library python-dotenv to turn it into a environment variable and call it during execution.

My reference is the [App Gallery](https://streamlit.io/gallery?category=llms) from streamlit!

What I want to accomplish here is something like this:

Maybe I'll use its repository as a guide.
